Q-Learning Agent
-------------------
This is the actual "learner" in the project. It maintains a Q-table —
a lookup table that estimates, for every (state, action) pair, how
much total future reward we expect if we take that action in that
state.

Since our Gym environment's state is a continuous vector (normalized
burst time / waiting time / priority per process, ~[0,1]), and tabular
Q-learning needs DISCRETE states, we first "bin" each continuous value
into one of a small number of buckets (e.g. "low / medium / high").
This turns each state into a fixed tuple of integers, which we can use
as a dictionary key.

Training uses an epsilon-greedy policy:
  - Start with epsilon = 1.0 (act completely randomly -> explore)
  - Decay epsilon toward 0.01 (mostly act on learned knowledge -> exploit)
  - Learning rate (alpha) = 0.1
  - Discount factor (gamma) = 0.95
  - Episodes = 1000 (configurable; fewer for a quick test run)

Q-learning update rule:
    Q(s, a) <- Q(s, a) + alpha *
               [r + gamma * max_a' Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)]
