"""
Round Robin (RR) Scheduler
----------------------------
Each process gets a fixed time slice ("quantum"). If it doesn't finish
within that slice, it goes to the back of the ready queue and waits
its turn again. This is fairer than FCFS under mixed burst-time
workloads, at the cost of more context switches.

We always pick index 0 (the front of the queue) because the
simulator's step() already appends unfinished processes to the back
of the queue — so "always run the front" naturally cycles through
everyone in round-robin order.
