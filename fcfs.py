First Come First Serve (FCFS) Scheduler
-----------------------------------------
The simplest policy: always run whichever process arrived first and
is still waiting. Since the simulator's ready queue already holds
processes in arrival order (new arrivals are appended to the back),
"pick the first one" is exactly FCFS behavior. Each process runs to
completion (time_slice=None) — no preemption.
